My brother, Dr Dominic Pimenta, his wife, Dr Dilsan Yilmaz, our friend, Dr Roshana Mehdian, our cousin, Nej D’jelal and I came together from our various backgrounds to create this initiative, to play our part in the crisis by helping to support our healthcare workers. For our family, like so many others, the crisis is personal. As two of our own family members are doctors who are losing colleagues every day, not to mention, fearing for their own lives, the call to action felt like a little light for us: a ray of hope in so much darkness.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":646,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Our key focal points with HEROES were to protect and support the safety and wellbeing of healthcare workers through the procurement and creation of PPE and to establish services such as food supply distribution and childcare services.

So when HEROES began thinking about setting up our website in order to take donations, Brad Goodall, the CEO and co-founder of Banked, stepped up to help.
