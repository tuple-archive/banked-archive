Whilst a single document has a maximum size limit, the size of a collection is essentially unbounded.

This allows us to hook up as many different cloud functions as we want, to listen for new events being appended, and gives us a nice way to keep each unit of work simple and self contained. Each function is responsible for calculating a given metric we are interested in, and can persist the new metric wherever we like. This also means the rest of our system needs to know nothing about event sourcing — each function can update a certain metric and push the updated information to PubSub (or wherever you like), to be consumed by any other part of the system that’s interested.

I confess mainly led by my wife, Latasha, who has cracked the bin colour Rubik’s cube. I have never seen a floating AmEx or Visa card out in the ocean, which is probably good news on many fronts. The information contained on that piece of plastic – name, 16 digit number, expiry date, and security code – are all extremely valuable. Once you have the person’s address you are off and running. So, when we throw it away, we tend to chop it up into little pieces, slicing across the numbers with scissors so that it couldn't be put back together. I think I picked that up from my Mum, watching her standing over the kitchen bin, orange handled scissors in hand, asking what she was doing. Most cards are made from polyvinyl chloride, a plastic which is difficult and expensive to recycle due to the high chlorine content (which, as a chemist at heart, is extremely hazardous). So they are unquestionably a part of our recycling conundrum that we simply have to solve.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":1105,"type":"strong"}]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"text$f2d914a5-52cd-4939-925f-aaf885d91a81","slice_type":"text","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"text":[{"type":"heading4","text":"When you use Banked, you do not need a card.
