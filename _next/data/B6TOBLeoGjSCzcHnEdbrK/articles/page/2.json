If customers do not understand the new payment method and how it works, they will not use it. They need to know what to expect. Most importantly, this education needs to come across as efficiently as possible. Customers are not interested in long-winded tutorials. They need to ‘get the gist’ in a few seconds. A great example is studying how contactless payments became mainstream in the UK.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":13,"type":"strong"},{"start":22,"end":416,"type":"strong"},{"start":363,"end":387,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://home.barclaycard/insights/2021/10/a-brief-history-of-contactless-payments/"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"While early contactless payments in the UK took place in 2007, few noticed. Then, consumers became increasingly educated through ‘contactless payment limit’ signs on systems they already frequented, such as TfL. In 2012, when TfL enabled London buses to accept contactless payments and contactless payment limits increased from GBP 15 to GBP 20, more traction began to take place. In 2014, the Oyster contactless readers appeared throughout the TfL network and were vital to the popularisation of the payment method.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":516,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The second element to consider when introducing new payment methods to consumers is incentivisation. Providing incentives to make something more attractive is nothing new: introductory offers have often been used to incentivise trials in many industries.
