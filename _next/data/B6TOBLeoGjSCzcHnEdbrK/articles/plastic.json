I confess mainly led by my wife, Latasha, who has cracked the bin colour Rubik’s cube. I have never seen a floating AmEx or Visa card out in the ocean, which is probably good news on many fronts. The information contained on that piece of plastic – name, 16 digit number, expiry date, and security code – are all extremely valuable. Once you have the person’s address you are off and running. So, when we throw it away, we tend to chop it up into little pieces, slicing across the numbers with scissors so that it couldn't be put back together. I think I picked that up from my Mum, watching her standing over the kitchen bin, orange handled scissors in hand, asking what she was doing. Most cards are made from polyvinyl chloride, a plastic which is difficult and expensive to recycle due to the high chlorine content (which, as a chemist at heart, is extremely hazardous). So they are unquestionably a part of our recycling conundrum that we simply have to solve.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":1105,"type":"strong"}]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"text$f2d914a5-52cd-4939-925f-aaf885d91a81","slice_type":"text","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"text":[{"type":"heading4","text":"When you use Banked, you do not need a card.

This is a huge contrast to how payments traditionally work: at the moment, we all authorise the retailer to pull money out of our account by giving them our bank details.
