However, both  markets are not resting on their laurels, striving to build on their  strong lead and cement themselves as the home of  open banking innovation. The EU Commission's recent proposed  legislation  PSR1, replacing EU directive PSD2, focuses on improving financial  API performance, placing an increased focus on the standardisation of  financial data throughout payments infrastructure. This effort begins  with enhanced data collection, with the commission  inserting article ”Prohibited obstacles to data access’, outlawing a  range of barriers to data collection utilised by financial institutions  to gate keep customer information.","spans":[{"start":334,"end":339,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:04cc5bd5-196f-11ee-806b-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"PSR1’s increased flow of payments data will be accessible by improved  APIs, with new guidelines setting minimum data requirements for API  functionality whilst also improving performance. This fresh approach  requires financial institutions to meet a minimum  latency and downtime, reducing development costs for fintechs  integrating with the APIs and increasing their performance. The EU  Commission’s directive  PSD3 focuses on a different objective, standardising the licensing  and regulatory frameworks of all 27 members. This is an exciting move  for fintechs and financial institutions, vastly reducing the cost of  providing their services in multiple EU member  states. The new regulation also implements common-sense improvements,  including streamlined authentication processes, standardising the  payment settlement layer.","spans":[{"start":415,"end":420,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:e09b163c-1687-11ee-806b-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The EU’s PSR1 and PSD3 will deliver large advancements in how  fintechs build and licence their products, reducing costs and increasing  potential functionality, but real concerns remain regarding fraud  prevention and data security.

The approach is showing early  signs of success, with March’s Australian  open banking ecosystem map detailing 95 active data holders and  99.25% consumer bank account coverage.
