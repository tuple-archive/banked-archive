Four years ago, only 7% of all payments in the UK were made through contactless methods. Now, 83% of people in the UK use contactless and not a single age group or region reports below 75% usage. Part of this shift can be attributed to the pandemic and the social distancing measures that accelerated the digitisation of payments around the world.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":442,"type":"strong"},{"start":189,"end":228,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/contactless-now-accounts-more-quarter-all-uk-payments"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"However, we also know that the pandemic simply accelerated trends that were already starting to take hold.

Their focus from day one is getting a customer. They will do everything they can to get you to use their product and so strive for something much, much better than the status quo. It’s hard to do that in banking because the barriers to entry are so high. Regulation and capital are two enormous hurdles before you can engage with a single customer.

Instead, they care about their balance sheet, and the regulator, but little else.

And how do you get funding to start the bakery when you need a license before you can sell a single bread roll?
