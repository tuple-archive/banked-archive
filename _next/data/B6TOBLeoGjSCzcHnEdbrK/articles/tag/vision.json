Yet the banks give them away for free, transferring those charges to other products. If your local shop gave away milk and bread for free, you’d be more likely to stick with them. But how do you start a bakery if the shop is giving bread away for free? It’s anti-competitive, so it wouldn’t be allowed. And how do you get funding to start the bakery when you need a license before you can sell a single bread roll? Then you need a team, a final product, and money before you can even apply for that license. If you don’t get your authorisation, what then? Few other industries have walls this high.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":685,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"For banking to change, it needs to be unbundled.
