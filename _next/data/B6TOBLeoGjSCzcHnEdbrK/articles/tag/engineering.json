No bank would store just your current balance, and throw away the changes.

Each document is part of a collection alongside other documents, and each document can have sub-collections, which each contain further documents and so on, ad infinitum. Whilst a single document has a maximum size limit, the size of a collection is essentially unbounded. So this is starting to look like a good match — each of our events (a small blob of data) maps nicely to a document, and we can group these events into unbounded collections, which is ideal as the history of our application keeps growing.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":731,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One obvious issue here is reading back the data.

Firestore then fires handy triggers whenever a new document is created. This allows us to hook up as many different cloud functions as we want, to listen for new events being appended, and gives us a nice way to keep each unit of work simple and self contained. Each function is responsible for calculating a given metric we are interested in, and can persist the new metric wherever we like. This also means the rest of our system needs to know nothing about event sourcing — each function can update a certain metric and push the updated information to PubSub (or wherever you like), to be consumed by any other part of the system that’s interested.
