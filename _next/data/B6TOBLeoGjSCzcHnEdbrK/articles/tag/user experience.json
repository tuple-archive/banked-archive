As above-mentioned, whilst there are some improvements for consumers, these are not enough on their own to drive a change in behaviour. Incentivisation strategies should be considered if there is really an intention to attract consumers from existing Direct Debit agreements. The value offered by VRPs to consumers needs to outweigh the potential drawbacks, such as clunky online banking authentication experiences or the hassle of having to set up a new financial instrument for an ongoing recurring payment. ","spans":[{"start":0,"end":585,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In conclusion, VRPs won’t be a game changer but rather an improvement or an evolution of existing recurring payment methods today (Direct Debit, Card on File). Unless VRPs are implemented in a consistent way with controls on commercials and clear customer protection, it is unlikely to take off. While VRPs might not revolutionise the industry overnight, the collaboration between banks and regulators will remain key.
