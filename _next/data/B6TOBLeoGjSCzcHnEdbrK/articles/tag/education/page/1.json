Some form of event sourcing looked like a good fit, because the question is, in essence, a temporal one, i.e. how have the responses from each API changed over time.

The basic structure of Firestore is alternating documents and collections — with a document being a single blob of data. Each document is part of a collection alongside other documents, and each document can have sub-collections, which each contain further documents and so on, ad infinitum. Whilst a single document has a maximum size limit, the size of a collection is essentially unbounded. So this is starting to look like a good match — each of our events (a small blob of data) maps nicely to a document, and we can group these events into unbounded collections, which is ideal as the history of our application keeps growing.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":731,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One obvious issue here is reading back the data.

Firestore automatically sets up an index for each field in our document, so as long as we include a timestamp for each event, we get a pretty simple way to very quickly retrieve the latest N events for whichever collection we are interested in.

Firestore then fires handy triggers whenever a new document is created. This allows us to hook up as many different cloud functions as we want, to listen for new events being appended, and gives us a nice way to keep each unit of work simple and self contained. Each function is responsible for calculating a given metric we are interested in, and can persist the new metric wherever we like. This also means the rest of our system needs to know nothing about event sourcing — each function can update a certain metric and push the updated information to PubSub (or wherever you like), to be consumed by any other part of the system that’s interested.

That means it has become the default digital wallet for most people living in China. The way payment is initiated is through QR (quick response) codes. Merchants or vendors generate a transaction QR code according to the WeChat Payment Protocol and the payer goes to scan the QR code in their app to complete the payment. This method is used for payments made in physical stores, as well as websites, to purchase from advertising and other scenarios. This cuts down on waiting times at checkout counters, incentivizes users with on-going offers, and more importantly, for more independent or street vendors, it cuts through the need for physical payment terminals or card processors as well as the need to transport cash, meaning less of a theft risk.
