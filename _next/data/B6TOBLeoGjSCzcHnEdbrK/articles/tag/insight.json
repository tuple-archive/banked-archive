Some form of event sourcing looked like a good fit, because the question is, in essence, a temporal one, i.e. how have the responses from each API changed over time. This felt like the key to a suitable use case for ES — it has to match the reality of the world you are modelling. If that fits, everything else tends to fall into place.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":642,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"So we began to explore how we might put the theory into practice. There’s a lot of choice when it comes to the technology available. Tools like Kafka and EventStore are powerful and seem to be common choices, but the steep learning curve requires a non-trivial investment in developer time, and they also involve a reasonable commitment in ongoing maintenance. We wanted something managed, that’s quick to get going, and can be easily explained to other devs. It needs to be scalable too, because the number of events we’ll be chucking at it is significant.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":557,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Enter Google’s Firestore.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":25,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Firestore is a NoSQL document database, with a few handy features that make it a pretty great fit. The basic structure of Firestore is alternating documents and collections — with a document being a single blob of data. Each document is part of a collection alongside other documents, and each document can have sub-collections, which each contain further documents and so on, ad infinitum. Whilst a single document has a maximum size limit, the size of a collection is essentially unbounded. So this is starting to look like a good match — each of our events (a small blob of data) maps nicely to a document, and we can group these events into unbounded collections, which is ideal as the history of our application keeps growing.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":731,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One obvious issue here is reading back the data. Given such a big collection of events, we definitely don’t want to end up searching through the whole collection to get the information we need. This is where some careful structuring of the data makes all the difference. We want to group documents together in such a way that the collection contains all the events we are interested in (but no more than that) for a given operation, and then make sure we have an index for every field we need to query. Firestore automatically sets up an index for each field in our document, so as long as we include a timestamp for each event, we get a pretty simple way to very quickly retrieve the latest N events for whichever collection we are interested in.

Cloud functions were an obvious choice here. Our events were already being published to PubSub, so it was simple to set up a cloud function that consumed these events and appended them to the appropriate collection in Firestore. Firestore then fires handy triggers whenever a new document is created. This allows us to hook up as many different cloud functions as we want, to listen for new events being appended, and gives us a nice way to keep each unit of work simple and self contained. Each function is responsible for calculating a given metric we are interested in, and can persist the new metric wherever we like. This also means the rest of our system needs to know nothing about event sourcing — each function can update a certain metric and push the updated information to PubSub (or wherever you like), to be consumed by any other part of the system that’s interested. So it’s totally decoupled, and doesn’t slow anyone else down if ES is not their thing.
