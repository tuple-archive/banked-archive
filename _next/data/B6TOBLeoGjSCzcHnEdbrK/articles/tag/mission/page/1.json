If you're new to what that means, or how it differs from existing money-moving practices, we've written a simple introduction to account-to-account payments here. Essentially, we made a faster way for money to move and enhanced the value of each transaction by adding increased functionality, insight, and optionality within both the checkout and back-end. The full potential unlocked by our platform is constantly emerging, but the driving force of this development remains consistent: useful, intuitive, helpful experiences.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":704,"type":"strong"},{"start":335,"end":339,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://banked.com/post/account-to-account-payments"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ecwid opens a door for Banked to quickly and easily help thousands of small businesses on their journeys.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":105,"type":"strong"}]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"text$c80cd1eb-c091-4abd-8022-dc0e32be287a","slice_type":"text","slice_label":null},{"primary":{},"items":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":2766,"height":1710},"alt":"ecwid integration checkout","copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/banked/e257314d-c881-4f79-a476-3c814dec0151_ecwid-screen-01.png?auto=compress,format","id":"YU4ZDhAAACMA1XlW","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}},"caption":[]}],"id":"images$5c695cb4-7aee-42bd-96ca-26a8880ec126","slice_type":"images","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"text":[{"type":"heading3","text":"How can Banked help Ecwid's store owners?","spans":[{"start":0,"end":41,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Time to pull out the trusty bullet points:","spans":[{"start":0,"end":42,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"list-item","text":"Instant payments","spans":[{"start":0,"end":16,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"list-item","text":"Direct payments","spans":[{"start":0,"end":15,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"list-item","text":"Low fees","spans":[{"start":0,"end":8,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"list-item","text":"Microtransactions","spans":[{"start":0,"end":17,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"list-item","text":"Automated refunds","spans":[{"start":0,"end":17,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"What's not covered in the above list is the impact these changes have on small businesses or, more pertinently, the negative impact existing payment providers can have on small businesses that Banked negates.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":208,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"For a new business (just the type looking for an e-commerce solution and discovering Ecwid), payments can influence those make-or-break early months and, for small businesses, make-or-break can be a constant state.
