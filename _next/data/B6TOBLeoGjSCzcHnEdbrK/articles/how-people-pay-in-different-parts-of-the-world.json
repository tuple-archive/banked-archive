That means it has become the default digital wallet for most people living in China. The way payment is initiated is through QR (quick response) codes. Merchants or vendors generate a transaction QR code according to the WeChat Payment Protocol and the payer goes to scan the QR code in their app to complete the payment. This method is used for payments made in physical stores, as well as websites, to purchase from advertising and other scenarios. This cuts down on waiting times at checkout counters, incentivizes users with on-going offers, and more importantly, for more independent or street vendors, it cuts through the need for physical payment terminals or card processors as well as the need to transport cash, meaning less of a theft risk.
